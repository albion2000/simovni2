A written description is ambiguous. A picture is worth a thousand words. 

A 3D animation can fully describe the visual and spatio-temporal aspects of an observation. 

By simulating physics (even very simplified) or ensuring at least some internal consistency in the trajectories, a simulation can help test/reject hypotheses.

We can now add one more layer of realism, by simulating the events over the real environment, on site, in real time. By the use of augmented reality

The advance is threefold : 
  * quality of the parameters estimations
  * direct validation method
  * fidelity and realism of the reports
