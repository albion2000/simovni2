# simovni2
Unity3d project for Simovni2 on Hololens2 / OpenXR

Augmented Reality for more fidelity in UAP reports and cognitive psychology studies

The main documentation can be found here https://ufowaves.org/enquetes/simovni2

especially https://ufowaves.org/enquetes/simovni2/doku.php?id=simovni2:implementation

This demo should compile as is. 
Check the things to tune in the implementatin documentation (only 2 things)

A written description is ambiguous. A picture is worth a thousand words. 

A 3D animation can fully describe the visual and spatio-temporal aspects of an observation. 

By simulating physics (even very simplified) or ensuring at least some internal consistency in the trajectories, a simulation can help test/reject hypotheses.

We can now add one more layer of realism, by simulating the events over the real environment, on site, in real time. By the use of augmented reality

The advance is threefold : 
  * quality of the parameters estimations
  * direct validation method
  * fidelity and realism of the reports
